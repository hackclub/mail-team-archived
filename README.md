## Supplies
Listed below are the essential supplies for operating a full Mail Team Node.

### Printer
All Nodemasters must have a dedicated printer for printing shipping labels, letters, and Type A packaging.

This printer **must** have the following essential features:
* Duplex Printing
* Email-to-Print
* Built-in Wifi

The Nodemaster should connect their printer to WiFi, configure it to receive Email-to-Print emails, and send the associated email address to @cwalker.

**Nodemasters must keep all printer packaging** to ease transfer of the printer to another Nodemaster upon concluding their tour of duty.

The current recommended printer is the [HP m254dw](https://www.amazon.com/HP-LaserJet-Wireless-Replenishment-T6B60A/dp/B073R2WVKB/).

### Paper
The correct paper for printed letters and Type A packaging is 65lb A4 sheet.

Letters and Type A Wallets should be printed onto white stock. Type A Envelopes should be printed on a festive color of the Nodemaster's choosing. The only colors forbidden for Type A Envelopes are White and Black.

To reiterate, each Nodemaster must have at least **two** types of paper on hand: White and Colored.

### Label Sheets
The Nodemaster's printer is always stocked with double-4x6 A4-size label sheets. When printed, each label sheet will have an Interior label, an Exterior label, plus details about the mission in the upper-left corner. Once the labels are used, the remaining sheet is retained as a "receipt" for the mission.
