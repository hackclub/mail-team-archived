# HCP Type B
Packaging Type B denotes prefabricated cardboard boxes, such as the 6"x4"x2" boxes we have used for many years to ship stickers.

Because even the smallest boxes contain hundreds of stickers, they are mostly used for shipping stickers to hackathons or large clubs with high sticker utilization.

Type B packages may also contain other non-sticker supplies for club leaders, event organizers, or Mail Team Nodemasters.

## Type B1
Type B1 is the 6"x4"x2" folded cardboard box. It is primarily used to ship stickers (up to 300 stickers at a time, usually as full shrink-wrapped bundles).
